<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>We are a global tech company with a local heart. Founded in Los Angeles, we have
grown into a diverse team of over 60 professionals working remotely from all
corners of the globe.</p>

<img class="building" height="300px" src="/img/building.jpg" /> 

<p>Our mission is to provide safe, reliable, and compliant software solutions. We
specialize in standards compliance and best practices, ensuring our products not
only meet but exceed industry expectations. Our commitment to safety and quality
has earned us the trust of some of the biggest players in the tech industry,
including Microsoft.</p>

<p>Despite our global reach, we maintain the warmth and personalized service of a
smaller company. At Infty, every client is unique, and every project receives
the individual attention it deserves.</p>
